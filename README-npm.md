## Overview

Integration and end-to-end testing of Ledger Apps is a manual and time consuming process. We believe that the Ledger apps ecosystem is
lacking an adequate approach with respect to testing. The Zemu Framework is our solution for this problem. Under the hood, Zemu uses
Ledger's project [speculos](https://github.com/ledgerHQ/speculos). It's currently being used in every Ledger App built by Zondax, among many
others (such as Ethereum one built by Ledger team).

_Zemu is an emulation and testing framework for Ledger Nano S/S+/X devices._

## Features

- Minimal configuration + Docker based
- Speculos/Qemu based emulation
- Easy JS API
  - Mocha / Jest compatible
  - Parallelized testing
  - Abstracted device control (buttons, reset, etc.)
  - Navigate thru screens and take screenshots of them
- Debugging (support for CLion and vscode, even mixed C/Rust)
